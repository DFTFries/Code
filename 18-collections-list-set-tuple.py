# collection = single "variable" used to store multiple values
#   List  = [] ordered and changeable. Duplicates OK
#   Set   = {} unordered and immutable, bit Add/Remove OK. NO duplicates // immutable = unveränderlich
#   Tuple = () ordered and unchangeable. Duplicates OK. FASTER


fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"]
# print(dir(fruits))
# print(help(fruits))
# print(len(fruits))        # shows the amount of values in the collection
# print("apple" in fruits)  # returns a boolean

# print(fruits[0])          # use [start:end:step] after variable to access specific values // remember -1 in step reverses the order

# for fruit in fruits:      # common to use singular version of the word as counter in for loop - helps with understanding
#     print(fruit)
